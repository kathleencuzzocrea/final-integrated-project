            <p class="col-span-full">Algonquin Park, the first provincial park in Ontario, protected from the noise and rush of civilization, this world-renowned park in Ontario is a sanctuary for the rugged beauty of the maple, pine, moose, and wolves. A Provincial Park since 1893, the 7500 square kilometers (3500 square miles) of Algonquin Park are home to a diverse and unblemished eco-system that can be found nowhere else on earth.</p>
            <p class="col-span-full">Glaciers that receded ten thousand years ago created the distinctive rock outcroppings and spring-fed lakes of Algonquin. These mountains of ice have left the park with a rough, stark beauty. This, combined with its location, 3 hours northeast of Toronto and 2 1/2 hours west of Ottawa makes Algonquin an ideal attraction for those looking to escape the hustle of the city.</p>
            <p class="col-span-full">This majestic park, minutes away and seen from our lakeshore, is awe-inspiring and completely peaceful with the incredible beauty of nature. Come experience the Algonquin grandeur, with all its fresh clean air, deep blue skies, rich green forests and hundreds of pristine lakes. </p>

            <img src="images/galeairy-mob.jpg" class="col-span-full">
            <p class="col-span-full">Couples resort is located on the shores of Galeairy Lake, with direct access to Algonquin Park. Originally named Long lake which was renamed to Galeairy Lake because the lake borders Nightengale and Airy townships.</p>
            <p class="col-span-full">Galeairy Lake is 11 kilometres (7 miles) long, land locked and extends mostly inside the boundaries of Algonquin Park . Explore the many secluded coves by canoe or kayak and search for loons, beaver, otter and moose. Pull up on shore, have a picnic and go for a swim.</p>
            <p class="col-span-full">Swimming in this lake is great. It is very clean and safe, with water temperatures hitting 25C (78F) by the end of July. Typically the lake temperature is above 18C (70F) from the third week of June to the first week of September.</p>
